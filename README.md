# DNN-RE
Optimising Rule Extraction for Deep Neural Networks.  The project is motivated by the work of the DeepRED algorithm that performs Rule Extraction on a DNN.  If you have any questions feel free to message on sk940@cam.ac.uk

### Data format
The data expected by DNN-RE:
- `data.csv` - All data
- `NN_labels.txt` - Classifications of Neural Network on all data
- `TRUE_labels.txt` - True labels of all data instances
- `model_fold_<n>.h5` - Trained Neural Network for each fold
